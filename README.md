# tic_tac_toe
Example of a python tic-tac-toe game for Code Camp @LMAX.

Demonstrates some fundamental principles in programming, such as:
  - variables
  - functions
  - loops
  - arrays

If you're a student reading this, remember:
  1. Google is your best friend.
  2. Laziness is good, but don't copy-paste things without understanding them. It will mess you up later on.
  3. It's ok and good to fail - failure is necessary to learning. Keep trying and fail upwards!


(The board looks absolutely disgusting, see if you can make a fancier one.)

[[' ' '1' '2' '3']

Player O: a3

[[' ' '1' '2' '3']
 ['A' 'X' 'X' 'O']
 ['B' '-' '-' '-']
 ['C' 'O' '-' '-']]
Player X: b2

[[' ' '1' '2' '3']
